## [2.8.0] - 2026-01-10

### Added
- **Broadcast Hotkeys** - Send keystrokes to all EVE windows simultaneously
  - Configure trigger key (e.g., Ctrl+F1) and key to send (e.g., F1)
  - Useful for fleet broadcasts (F1-F9), jump commands, etc.
  - UI in Automation tab with add/remove entries
  - Supports multiple broadcast hotkey mappings
- **Preview Filter** - Quick filter in Overview toolbar to search windows by character name
  - Type to filter visible previews
  - Status bar shows filtered count
- **Keyboard Window Control** - Number keys 1-9 activate windows by position when Overview tab is focused
- **Performance Benchmarks** - New `benchmarks/benchmark_core.py` for profiling hot paths

### Changed
- Consolidated duplicate `ScreenGeometry` class and `get_screen_geometry()` function into shared `utils/screen.py` module (DRY refactoring)
- Refactored `auto_arrange_grid` into shared `get_pattern_positions()` function (complexity 16 → 6)
- Refactored `calculate_grid_layout` into helper methods (complexity 16 → 7)
- Refactored `_on_key_press` by extracting `_MODIFIER_KEYS`, `_track_modifier_press()`, `_get_key_char()` helpers
- Refactored EVE settings sync functions by extracting `_iter_settings_dirs()`, `_process_log_files()`, `_create_char_info()` helpers
- Refactored `audit_actions` by extracting `_count_actions_by_home_and_scope()`, `_find_duplicate_homes()` helpers
- Refactored `build_window_context_menu` by extracting `_build_zoom_submenu()`, `_add_registry_action()` helpers
- All functions now pass cyclomatic complexity threshold (C901 ≤ 10)

### Security
- Added Bandit security scanner to dev dependencies and CI
- Configured pyproject.toml with appropriate skips for X11 tool usage

### Performance
- **Alert detection 400x faster** - Optimized red flash detection from 42ms to 0.1ms per frame
  - Downsample images before analysis (160x90 vs 1920x1080)
  - Single resize operation shared between red flash and screen change detection
  - Now well under 1ms target, enabling higher frame rates

### Testing
- Added 22 new tests for v2.7 features (broadcast hotkeys, preview filter, keyboard control)
- Total test count: 1497

## [2.7.0] - 2026-01-10
