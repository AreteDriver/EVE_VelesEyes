## Post-Recording

### Optimize GIF
```bash
# If using peek, output is already optimized
# If file is >10MB, reduce FPS or scale down:
ffmpeg -i demo.gif -vf "fps=15,scale=1280:-1:flags=lanczos" -y demo_optimized.gif

# Check size
ls -lh demo.gif
```

### Add to Repository
```bash
# Copy to repo root
cp demo.gif /home/arete/Argus_Overview/demo.gif

# Update README.md (add at top after title)
# ![Demo](demo.gif)

git add demo.gif README.md
git commit -m "Add 90-second capability demo GIF"
git push origin main
```

## Recording Tips

**Smooth Mouse Movement:**
- Move cursor deliberately and smoothly
- Pause briefly on buttons before clicking (1 second)
- No erratic movements

**Timing:**
- Practice the sequence 2-3 times before recording
- Use a timer to stay under 90 seconds
- Actions should feel deliberate but not rushed

**Visual Quality:**
- Ensure EVE clients are showing interesting scenes (space, asteroids, ships)
- Make sure character names are visible (but can obscure if needed for privacy)
- Window borders and titles should be clear

**What NOT to Show:**
- Don't fumble with UI
- Don't show error messages or bugs
- Don't include unnecessary waiting/loading
- No narration needed - let capability speak for itself

---

## Alternative: Split Recording
If 90 seconds is too tight, record in segments and merge:

```bash
# Record 3 separate clips
# Merge with ffmpeg
ffmpeg -i part1.gif -i part2.gif -i part3.gif -filter_complex "[0:v][1:v][2:v]concat=n=3:v=1[outv]" -map "[outv]" demo.gif
```

**Goal:** Viewer watches and thinks "This is professional, powerful, and exactly what I need for multi-boxing."
